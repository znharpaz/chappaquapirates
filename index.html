  <ul><u>What's This All About</u></ul>
  <p><pre>
    We are a science team called the Chappaqua Pirates. We compete against other teams
in a program called <a href="https://www.globalfinals.org/">Destination Imagination (DI)</a>. Our team just became the NY State
champions and we are now headed to Globals in Tennessee where we will be facing
teams from all around the world. Our challenge was to create a maze traveler using
technechical methods and to put on a performance to narrate the maze travelers quest.
Click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xOuRYgpPIE&t=260s">HERE</a> to take a look at our performance from the performance.

  To compete in this event, our seven member team
and family need to travel to Tennessee. Given the significant cost to go, weâ€™re
hoping to raise funds for our team to compete in this exciting event.
